Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/EshaKhadeejaC/AutoExaminer.git
cd AutoExaminer
üìù Question Generation
AutoExaminer generates questions through the following process:

Content Analysis: The textbook is processed, chunked, and vectorized
Topic Selection: An LLM analyzes the content to identify key topics
Question Formulation: For each selected topic:
Relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector database
The LLM formulates questions based on the chunk content and question type
Difficulty level is applied to adjust complexity
Question Types
MCQs
Generated with one correct answer and three plausible distractors.

Short Answer
Designed to be answered in 2-3 sentences, focusing on definitions and concepts.

Long Answer
In-depth questions requiring detailed explanations, analysis, or discussion of topics.

Case Study
Real-world scenarios that require application of concepts from the textbook.

üìä Evaluation System
The evaluation system combines:

1.Handwritten Text Recognition: Processes scanned answer sheets
2.Pattern Matching: Checks for specific keywords and phrases from the answer key
3.Semantic Understanding: Uses LLM to evaluate the overall meaning and correctness
4.Scoring Algorithm: Weights different aspects of the answer to provide a fair assessment
üíª UI Integration
The UI is built using AppScripts and integrates with Google Drive for data management:

1.User inputs preferences in the AppScripts interface
2.Data is sent to Google Drive
3.Backend processes the request and stores results in Google Drive
4.AppScripts UI retrieves and displays the results
